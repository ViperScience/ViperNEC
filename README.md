# ViperNEC #
Port of the Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC) Version 2 from FORTRAN to C.

## F2c ##
The FORTRAN to C conversion program F2c was used to generate a C version of the original NEC FORTRAN code. The generated C code is very cryptic and not easily maintained or debugged. It only serves as a starting point for the translation. For directions on the installation and usage of F2c see the [netlib directory](http://www.netlib.org/f2c/) and the [wiki article at gnukies.org](http://gunkies.org/wiki/F2c).
